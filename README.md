# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

Welcome to the Requirement Analysis in Software Development repository. This space is dedicated to outlining, detailing, and illustrating the key processes and outputs that take place during the Requirement Analysis stage of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

For demonstration purposes, weâ€™ll be using a Booking Management System (modeled after Airbnb) as a case study to showcase how requirement analysis is applied in a real-world context.
